# **Biking the US**


### **What is it about?**
The following project provides 6 months of customer data from a rental bike company in the US for three cities:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

You can easily get the respective information you want by answering to the various questions asked via user input and also see raw data if required. Just follow the questions asked and start over again if you want to, so you can get more information by changing your selections.

_Just get started!_

### **Files used**
In order to get the query running, the following files provided by Udacity have been used:
1. Washington.csv
2. New_York_City.csv
3. Chicago.csv

The query itself runs within bikeshare.py

### **Credits**
The project data has been provided by Udacity and the rental bike company [Motivateo](https://www.motivateco.com).

_Great Thanks!_
